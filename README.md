# Code and data repository for "Bayesian dynamic autoregressive models for count data: an application to COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and United States"

This repository hosts code and data necessary to reproduce the results in: Arkaprava R., Giudici P. and Tarantino B., "Bayesian dynamic autoregressive models for count data: an application to COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and United States".

Codes to fit Bayesian dynamic Poisson log-link models including constant or time-varying coefficients for count data. 

BAYES_log fits time-constant AR(p), INGARCH(p,q), ARX(p), INGARCHX(p,q) model; tvBAYES_log fits time-varying AR(p), INGARCH(p,q), ARX(p), INGARCHX(p,q) model.

Application to COVID-19 data is provided.
